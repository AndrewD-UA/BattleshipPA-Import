1) Standard game
2) Power-up game
  - Nuke powerup (hits 3x3 square)
  - Strafing run (hits 5 square in a line)
  - Reveal (Randomly picks a ship and permanently reveals it)
  - Second chance ( miss first, get a second)
  - Shield (Blocks a single shot to the ship, then goes away)
  - Relocate (move a ship mid-game)

 If we have time, implementing a multiplayer option would be fantastic
