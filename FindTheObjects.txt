- AI Object
  - For singleplayer game, handles movement
  - Is created with a new game/board and references a particular level of AI

- Easy/Medium/Hard/Extreme AI Classes
  - Different algorithms to implement next move
  - Easy picks randomly
  - Medium will not pick square it's already picked
  - Hard will randomly pick until it hits a ship, then it will fire at surrounding squares until the ship is sunk.
  - Extreme will fire at the statistically most likely squares for ship placement based on scraped data.  
  	Furthermore, once it hits a ship, it will fire around the ship until it detects the direction of the ship's orientation.
  	It will then only fire along the ship's axis until the ship is sunk.
